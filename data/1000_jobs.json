You'll have the flexibility to work remotely, support a growing team, and contribute to a mission that makes a difference in people’s lives. If you're organized, proactive, and thrive in a relationship-driven role, this opportunity could be a perfect fit for you.\nOur Story Starts with People Like You\nThe two founders, best friends, were running businesses that needed great talent fast. So, they started building remote teams across countries like the Philippines, Colombia, and India. Not only did it work, it thrived. They realized that talent isn’t limited by geography. With today’s technology and high-speed internet, we’re able to build high-performing global teams that support businesses across the U.S. So ClearDesk was born.\nToday, ClearDesk helps U.S. businesses grow by building world-class remote teams. We don’t just connect talent; we manage the entire experience, from recruiting to retention. And while we help clients thrive, we also stay deeply committed to helping our remote team members build real, lasting careers that support their lives and their families.\nThat’s where you come in.\nThe Role: Healthcare Sales Development Representative\nImagine being the first person a potential partner or referral source hears from. You’re not just making cold calls or sending generic emails. You’re building connections, creating opportunities, and guiding partners from curiosity to collaboration. When a new lead comes in, you’re on it. When a referral partner goes quiet, you’re following up. When a client finds the right care, you know part of that journey began with you.\nYou don’t just track data, you create momentum. Behind every call, every follow-up, there’s a real person or business that needs support, whether it’s a company seeking partners or a family in need of care. You’ll ensure no opportunity slips through the cracks, maintain relationships, and drive meaningful results. And when things are quieter? You’ll assist with social media or admin tasks, making sure every day counts.\nWhat Your Days Might Look Like:\nConduct targeted research to identify high-value referral sources and potential partners within the company’s niche — focusing on businesses serving affluent clients with significant in-home care needs\nPerform outbound cold calls to referral sources, facilities, and professionals, aiming to schedule warm, in-person meetings for the owner\nManage CRM data entry (Zoho or alternative), ensuring all outreach, follow-ups, and meeting details are accurately documented\nTrack referral sources, contact history, and meeting outcomes to create a clear picture of marketing effectiveness\nCoordinate email follow-ups with contacts, referral partners, and leads to maintain engagement and nurture relationships\nMonitor and update limited social media presence (primarily for awareness), posting relevant community and industry content as needed\nMaintain professional, relationship-focused communication that reflects the company’s mission and values\nAdjust outreach strategies based on results, offering suggestions to improve lead generation and meeting conversion rates\nWork closely with the owner to align outreach priorities with high-value marketing opportunities\nWho We Think Will Thrive in This Role:\nYou have experience in sales, outreach, or customer service (healthcare experience a plus)\nYou’re a strong communicator, skilled at purposeful follow-ups and building relationships\nYou’re highly organized and ensure outreach is tracked and managed effectively\nYou’re comfortable using CRMs like Zoho or similar tracking tools\nYou’re calm under pressure and can handle multiple tasks simultaneously\nYou love creating structure and keeping conversations moving\nYou’re reliable, responsive, and proactive in taking initiative\nYou enjoy collaborating and thriving in a remote team environment\nYou are willing to work in a US time zone schedule.\nYou can secure the required technical setup, including:\nAt least a 720p HD webcam\nA noise-canceling headset\nA primary internet connection of at least 25 Mbps\nA backup laptop, backup internet device, and backup power source\nA main computer with at least Intel Core i5 (or equivalent) and 8 GB RAM\nA backup computer with at least Intel Core i3 and 4 GB RAM\nWhy ClearDesk?\nBecause we believe work should be meaningful, even from home.\nAt ClearDesk, you’ll work with clients who respect your time and value your skills. You’ll join a remote-first team that genuinely supports you, and you’ll see the impact of your work in real, tangible ways that matter to the people you work with.\nWe don’t just want you to do your job.

        "description": "We are looking for an outstanding Lawyer to take on the role of Personal Legal Counsel to a confidential UHNW Principal based in Rockwell, Makati. The position will involve providing in-house legal support for the Principal’s personal investments (including a significant local real estate holding), philanthropic endeavours, family office setup, tax planning and family law, among other personal areas. In addition, the Principal is also the owner of a local cosmetics company and his media production company has a branch office in the Philippines that often requires legal support for contracts and other matters related to high-profile Netflix TV shows and movies. None of these positions individually require full-time, in-house counsel, but combined they constitute a full-time role.\nWe do not mind much about number of years of experience – the salary on offer (250k PHP) applies whether there are 5 years of experience or 20. We are more than open to someone who will grow with the role. We are looking for a candidate that is hungry to make a name for themselves and jump start their career and have both a significant budget and ample opportunities for helping to enable the right person to excel. We are avoidant of someone with significant experience that is simply trying to “rest and vest”, but we are open to someone with that experience who is still driven to excel. \nThe Principal has extensive experience working with lawyers in many jurisdictions and is specifically looking for someone who can strike the right balance between making things happen and ensuring he is fully protected legally. He is looking for someone with an interest in expanding in their role, always available to step up to operate as an interim executive at a company if there is a need and to assist in the hiring process of top executives.\nThis person should also act as a trusted adviser. For example, when it comes to contract review, rather than just nitpicking over legalese, we are looking for someone that can offer an opinion about the substance of the contract: “This contract might not make sense as a starting point, regardless of any changes we make to it” or “The terms of this agreement are not as favorable to you as they could be. We could counteroffer with an interest rate of X% and these additional terms instead.”\nThis is a rare opportunity for the right candidate, ideally a Bar Exam Topnotcher or among the top passers, to work directly with a business leader and gain exposure to both personal and corporate legal matters at an early stage of their career. The role offers a monthly salary of ₱250,000.\nKey Responsibilities\nProvide legal advice on personal, family office, tax, and business matters.\nDraft, review, and negotiate contracts across commercial, vendor, and media production agreements.\nEnsure compliance with governance, regulatory, and intellectual property requirements.\nConduct legal research and due diligence for investments, ventures, and private transactions.\nHandle confidential and sensitive legal issues with professionalism and discretion.\nCandidate Profile\nRecently passed the Philippine Bar Exam (within 5 years).\nBar Exam Topnotcher or among the top passers strongly preferred.\nGraduate of Ateneo, De La Salle, or UP, or another leading institution.\nStrong legal research, drafting, and communication skills in English and Tagalog.\nDiscreet, organized, adaptable, and comfortable working in a fast paced environment.\nProactive, detail oriented, and ready to take on broad responsibilities from the start.\nStrong can-do attitude, exhibiting high agency and taking full ownership of tasks.\nInnovative and creative in approach, finding a way to make things happen rather than just saying what cannot be done.\nLocation\nRockwell, Makati City (majority on site presence required)\nSalary and Benefits\n₱250,000 per month. 13 months.\nAnnual performance bonus.\n15 paid vacation leaves and 15 sick leaves.\nPrivate healthcare\nCoverage of BAR dues and training\nBudget for best tech and legal tools\nFree on site parking.\nFull private gym and sauna/cold plunge access (one of the best gyms in the country)\nUnique career development opportunity to work closely with a high profile Principal, with exposure to family office operations and hands on legal work in the cosmetics, media, and investment sectors."
